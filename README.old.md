nodeChat
========

An experiment to learn a bit about Node.js, by building a simple, web-based chat room.

Goals:
 * realtime, multiuser chat
 * login form without page reload
 * share as much code as reasonably possible between the client and server
 * become more familiar with git, specifically from the command line
