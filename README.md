nodeChat
========

A simple, web-based chat room, combining the worst of IRC and Discord by only including a tiny fraction of the features of either.

Initially created to toy with (the then-relatively new) nodeJS, practice jQuery, and learn to use git/GitHub. Now it's a "mature" project I intend to use as fodder for further learning.

Coming soon:
 - [ ] Modernize!
     - [x] Convert everything to use ES modules
     - [x] Other assorted new JS features should render most/all of underscore.js/jQuery unnecessary
     - [x] Update the other dependency, socket.io from 1.3 to latest (4.x?) ~~(or, *maybe*, work towards dropping it in favor of using web sockets directly?)~~
     - [ ] Probably some other code cleanup. My style/taste has changed (hopefully for the better) since 2013-17.
 - [ ] Dockerize! I'm late to the containerization party, but catching up doesn't seem *too* difficult.
 - [ ] \(Maybe\) Deno-ize! Deno and TypeScript are obviously way cooler than nodeJS and plain JavaScript! So what if the name won't be accurate anymore...

I *might* even get to some of those old feature requests, who knows?
